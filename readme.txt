Problem:
1:
I run into a problem that it showed the error " <‘error: expected ';', ',' or ')' before '&' token’ >" when I compiled the file of abstract_data_triple after it was saved to ".c" format.
It will be solved if you change the format ".c" to ".cpp", I have no idea why it would work, so I searched the problem on the Internet, and I found that many person have the same prolem and they said that "c不认引用传递，但是c++支持引用传递".

2:
This program must include <stdio.h> <stdlib.h> header file.
